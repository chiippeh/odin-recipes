        <h2>Complete Guide on how to fry sunny side up eggs</h2>
        <p>Even a complete idiot could follow this guide</p>
        <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons oil (canola/olive/butter)</li>
            <li>An egg :)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps :</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a non-stick or a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of cooking oil until the oil starts to shimmer. If using butter, wait until it stops sizzling, but before it starts to turn brown.</li>
            <li>Add the egg to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Wait until the white begins to set, and then use a fork to gently break up the white closest to the yolk, being careful not to pop the yolk. By doing this, you're pulling the layer of white that surrounds the yolk out towards the edge. This smooth move is used by diner cooks and chefs to cook the white evenly. It also means the egg won't have that gooey slime that turns so many people off with sunny side eggs.</li>
            <li>No need to flip; serve the egg when cooked so that whites are uniformly white (no longer clear). Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
